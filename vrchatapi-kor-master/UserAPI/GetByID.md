### DeveloperType

    - none
    - trusted
    - internal
    - moderator 

### WorldLocation

If the user is not connected it will be `offline`

If the user is online the location will be serialized as  `world_id:instance_id`

Sometimes the `instance_id` is set to the user id of that user, probably meaning this is some private instance.

there could also be a `~` that can have some info about the world instance, these are the ones I found

    - hidden(user_id)
    - friend
    - nonce(HEX)

Sometimes the location is set to `private`, probably meaning he is in a private world, will have to investigate.

### Status

    - active  (User can see requests)
    - join me (User autoaccepts requests)
    - busy (User ignores all requests)
    - offline
